     What is this experiment about?
        
    </h2>
    <p><h3>This experiment is designed to help those of us who do not understand what it is like to have a physical diffculty to recreate
        and experience what it is like to have a difficulty. 
        In this experiment we will concetrate on finger dexterity. 
        The goal is to help us to understand how hard it can be for people with limited 
        capability and chronic pain to do everyday things.</h3></p>
